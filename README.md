# One Time Pad

A clean and well-documented [one time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) written in JavaScript for NodeJS. It encrypts characters A-Z using a randomly-generated cipher key. 

To run: `node otp.js`

If you enter the plaintext `HELLO WORLD!` a possible ciphertext (of course based upon a random key) would be `XVUBX UWHVR!`
